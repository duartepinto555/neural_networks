## Introduction
This project was built using python 3.7.2.
The report was built using LaTeX

## Introduction


## How to run?
Executing the file "run.py" in the folder "src" executes the software as intended.
1. Execute the file "run.py" in the folder "src"
1. You'll be prompted to write a Learning Rate. This value should be a number between 0 and 1.
1. After the code has executed, a array will be appear on the Command Line representing the weights of the neurons


## Dependecies
This software was tested using Python 3.7.2, and requires only two default packages:
1. time
2. numpy
